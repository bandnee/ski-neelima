Reverse a string

shortest substring of str that contains all characters in S
O(n)

subset: Given a  set of elements 'N', 2^N (power of N)
Of the N elements I want (N choose i = 2(power of N))
SubString: Is a contiguous set of characters
(N+N-1+N-2 ..... 1) = N^2
SubSequences: (0,1,....... N-1) : 2^N


Brute force :
Generate all substrings  ( is N(square)  and N is to  check if each string  is indeed a
N(cube)

Prefix Search:
["bat","cat","bath","bar","cart"]

Binary Search

BruteForce :
len(prefix) = p
len(dict) = N
O(Np)
len(word) = M

Sort  and Binary Search:
N comparisions  at each level
O(NMlogN)
BinarySearch : O(plogN)

Trie/-Prefix Tree:
bar,bat,bath,car,cart
